  your tags for your before doing the upgrade, but it never hurts to
  make your own backup with notmuch dump.

  Previously on big endian architectures like sparc and powerpc the
  computation of SHA1 hashes was incorrect. This meant that messages
  with overlong or missing message-ids were given different computed
  message-ids than on more common little endian architectures like
  i386 and amd64.  If you use notmuch on a big endian architecture,
  you are strongly advised to make a backup of your tags using
  `notmuch dump` before this upgrade.  You can locate the affected
  files using something like:

  notmuch dump | \
    awk '/^notmuch-sha1-[0-9a-f]{40} / \
      {system("notmuch search --exclude=false --output=files id:" $1)}'

  There is an incompatible change in option syntax for dump and restore
  in this release. Please update your scripts.

  From upstream NEWS:

  The deprecated positional output file argument to notmuch dump has
  been replaced with an --output option. The input file positional
  argument for restore has been replaced with an --input option for
  consistency with dump.
