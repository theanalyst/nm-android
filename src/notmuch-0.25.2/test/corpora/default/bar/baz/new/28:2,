Sup certainly started a lot of people thinking...

Easier than that, notmuch (and sup too), provide a 'dump' command which
just lists all of the message IDs and their associated tags. Makes
saving tags easy and doesn't involve rewriting messages. I do this once
a day just before my computer is backed up to an external drive.

If the index is destroyed, you can reindex the messages and then reapply
all of the tags with 'notmuch restore'.
