Ah, here's where I planned a nice welcome. So welcome (again), Jan! :-)

I've been having a lot of fun with notmuch already, (though there have
been some days of pain before it was functional enough and my
email-reply latency went way up). But regardless---I got through that,
and I'm able to work more efficiently with notmuch now than I could with
sup before. So I'm happy.

And I'm delighted when other people find this interesting as well.

Thanks for the idea. I think I may have looked into org-mode years ago,
(when I was investigating planner-mode and various emacs "personal wiki"
systems for keeping random notes and what-not).

Yeah. I'll drop them a mail. Having a real emacs wizard on board would
be nice. (I'm afraid the elisp I've written so far for this project is
fairly grim.)
