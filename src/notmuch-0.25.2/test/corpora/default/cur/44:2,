Thanks, Jan. This is pushed now.

And did I say welcome to notmuch yet? (It's easy to lose track with all
the newcomers---which I'm not complaining about---especially since so
many are sharing code.)

PS. I actually really like the behavior of -C (especially when
installing a low-level library to avoid big waterfalls of needless
recompiles). But since we're *not* actually installing a library (yet)
I'm happy with this patch rather than writing code in configure to check
if "install -C" works or not.
