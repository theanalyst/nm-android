Hi Keith,

Once I finally got back on the ground again, I pushed out a revised
version of your patch, (didn't need the reply-to stuff anymore since I
had fixed that differently in the meantime).

I'm pretty happy with the state of this portion of the code now.

Thanks Keith and Mikhail for your input on and code to fix this bug.

-Carl
