Subject: [notmuch] [PATCH] Create a default notmuch-show-hook that
	highlights URLs and uses word-wrap
Message-ID: <1258532999-9316-1-git-send-email-keithp@keithp.com>

I created the notmuch-show-hook precisely so I could add these two
options, but I suspect most people will want them, so I just made them
the default. If you don't want them, you can use remove-hook to get
rid of this.
