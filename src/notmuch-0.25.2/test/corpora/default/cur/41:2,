Welcome, Lars!

I hadn't even seen that Keith's blog post had been picked up by lwn.net.
That's very interesting. So, thanks for coming and trying out notmuch.

Sadly, the lwn article coincided with me having just introduced this
bug, and then getting on a Trans-Atlantic flight. So I fixed the bug
fairly quickly, but there was quite a bit of latency before I could push
the fix out. It should be fixed now.

Notmuch works just fine with maildir---it's one of the things that it
likes the best.

Happy hacking,
