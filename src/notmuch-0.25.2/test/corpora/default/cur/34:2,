I got that too. I presume it's newly supported in GCC4.4?

strndup from V8:

char* strndup(char* str, size_t n) {
  // Stupid implementation of strndup since macos isn't born with
  // one.
  size_t len = strlen(str);
  if (len <= n)
    return StrDup(str);
  char* result = new char[n+1];
  size_t i;
  for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    result[i] = str[i];
  result[i] = '\0';
  return result;
}

for getline do you mind trying #define _GNU_SOURCE 1
before #include <stdio.h> in the offending files? The FreeBSD man pages
mentions that as a way of enabling the GNU version of getline().
