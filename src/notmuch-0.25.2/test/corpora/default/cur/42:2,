I don't like this---but that's because I use 'x' precisely *because* it
preserves these tags.

Otherwise, you might as well just remove inbox and unread as soon as the
message is presented to the user. And that's a bug in a lot of other
email programs that I'm unwilling to replicate.

We may run into a need to define different ways that people like to work
with their email here. (I know that so far I've just been coding up the
way I want my mail to work.)
