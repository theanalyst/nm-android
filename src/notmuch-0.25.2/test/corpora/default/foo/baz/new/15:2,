Hello,

First of all, notmuch is a wonderful idea, both the cmdline tool and
the emacs interface! Thanks a lot for writing it, I was really excited
when I read the announcement today.

Have you considered sending an announcement to the org-mode mailing list?
http://org-mode.org

Various ways of searching/referencing emails from emacs were discussed
there several times and none of them were as elegant as notmuch (not
even close). Maybe notmuch would attract some of the developers
there..
