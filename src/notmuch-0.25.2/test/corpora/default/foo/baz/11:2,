Threading the message also involves displaying the from and to contents,
which requires opening the message file. The alternative to the fix I
provided is to just parse all of the message headers when first opening
the message; it could then be immediately closed and the hash referred
to for all header data. Given the choice, just having the caller say
when it has finished with a message is probably a reasonable option...
