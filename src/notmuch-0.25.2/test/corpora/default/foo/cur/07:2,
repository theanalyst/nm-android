Hi Mikhail,

Welcome to notmuch, and thanks for these patches! I've pushed both of
them out now.

Keith ran into the same problem of "too many open files" and wrote a
more complex fix, (which included what you did here). His code can be
seen at:

	git://keithp.com/git/notmuch

I didn't apply Keith's fix yet, because I think I'd rather just fix the
indexer to store the In-Reply-To header in a separate term prefix from
the term used for the References header[*]. That will then let us lookup
the in-reply-to value later for thread constructions without having to
open the original email file at all.

-Carl

[*] Yes, this is my first post to our new mailing list and I'm already
spouting off about "terms" and "prefixes" without any definitions. I
apologize for that. I hope that people will ask questions freely here on
the list whenever anything is not clear, and I'll be glad to explain
things as needed. (Then when can shove answers into a HACKING document.)

PS. This reply is a great example of a feature that notmuch *almost*
supports already---repling to multiple messages at once. The "notmuch
reply" command line does everything necessary to make this work, but we
haven't yet hooked up any keybindings for this in the emacs client yet.
Obviously, 'r' from the search view could reply to the entire thread.
But when viewing a thread, anyone have a good keybinding suggestion?
(There's obviously 'R' as opposed to 'r', but I think we'll probably
want to distinguish "reply to sender" from "reply to all" before trying
to distinguish "reply to message" from "reply to thread" (which I
imagine is more rare of an operation).
