Hehe, I know that I wouldn't want to hand edit every autogenerated patch
people throw at me... What about just dropping everything before the
last "]" or ":" and putting an autogenerated prefix before it in a
pre-commit hook on your side?  

That should work most of the time... don't know... maybe other
subsystem maintainers have some more suggestions on reducing the
workload... this could even be an interesting topic for some summit...
