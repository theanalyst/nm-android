It's the most of the time bit that worries me, I'm generally reluctant
to script things like this when the scripts aren't very widely used and
it's a pain to get hooks distributed over all my systems and working for
all the things I need to apply patches for.

From my point of view my current approach is actually working pretty
well with most submitters, even people doing similar janitorial stuff.
