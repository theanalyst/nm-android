Come on guys, this debate is really horribly boring.

Either the maintainer wants the patch. Then he is certainly able to apply 
it no matter the subject line (I personally am getting a lot of patches 
which don't follow the format I am using in my tree ... converting 
Subject: lines is so trivial that I have never felt like bothering anyone 
about it ... it's basically single condition in a shellscript). Or the 
maintainer doesn't feel like the patch is worth it, and then the 
subject-line format really doesn't matter.
