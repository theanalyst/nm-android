My first reaction to this is, it's silly. Certainly a
subsystem-maintainer is capable of hacking something together that
suits his needs or may just use a good editor to get the job done.
After all, he might want to edit the commit message anyway. Also he has
to have his act together for all non-conforming submitters anyway,
because shurely, telling people to re-edit their patches subject line
is not what one would consider "welcoming to newbies",  or whatever it
is kernel subsystem maintainers have to be nowadays *g*... 

On second thought, if that facility existed, i think nobody would mind
it either. So, why not. I don't see a way to specify what to do with
cross-subsystem patches though. 

(MAINTAINERS seems to be the logical place to put this
information.)
