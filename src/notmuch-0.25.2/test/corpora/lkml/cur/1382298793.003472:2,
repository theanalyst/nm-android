Greg seems to rewrite patch subjects and is inconsistent
about case, so he might be doing that by hand.

DaveM doesn't appear to be choosy about patch subject lines.
He seems to take any sensible patch and as far as I know he
doesn't edit the subject lines.  He does reject inferior
patches outright.

The sound maintainers seem to rewrite patch subjects on an
ad-hoc basis.
