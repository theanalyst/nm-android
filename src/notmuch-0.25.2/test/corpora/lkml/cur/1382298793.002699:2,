Sadly, no it's not the right place.

That script just generates cc email addresses
for pre-formatted commit patches.

It'd have to be a script that modifies the git commit subject line
to the taste of the subsystem maintainer.

Right now, I use a commit script that's something like:

#!/bin/bash
echo "$1: Remove unnecessary semicolons" > msg
echo >> msg
#cat >> msg <<EOF
#Unnecessary semicolons should not exist.
#EOF
git commit -s -F msg $1

There could be a modification to $1 (path)
or some such.

Maybe a script like
./scripts/convert_commit_subject_to_subsystem_maintainer_taste
or something.

Care to write one in sh/bash/perl/python/c/ocaml/c#?

As far as I know, the only subsystem pedants^H^H^H^H^Hople
that care much about the commit subject style are
arch/x86 and sound.

I can understand the desire of these subsystem maintainers
to have a consistent style.  I think though that requiring
a subject header style without providing more than a
general guideline is a but much.

I'd use any other automated tool you want to provide.

cheers, Joe
