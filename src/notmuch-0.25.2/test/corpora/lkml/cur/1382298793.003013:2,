To query MAINTAINERS?  I'd assume that's where you'd want to put that
stuff?

Like I say I'd expect this to be a get_maintainers based lookup to dump
some data out?

If you look at the kernel you'll see quite a few subsystems which have
some sort of standard practice which they do try to enforce, you
shouldn't take silence as people being happy here - it's taken me some
considerable time to get round to mentioning this, for example, and I
might not have bothered if the patch had applied first time around.
Like working against -next it's one of these things that would make your
patches easier to deal with.

The general guideline I tend to go with is that if what you're doing
looks odd for the code you're submitting against for some reason you're
doing something wrong unless you understand why you're doing something
different and there's a good reason.

Like I say, I'd expect the lookup from the database to be handled by
get_maintainers.pl.  Having a separate database would seem odd.
