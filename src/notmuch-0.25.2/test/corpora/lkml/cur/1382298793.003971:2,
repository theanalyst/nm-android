It seems to be the way we're heading in general - look at all the recent
work on MAINTAINERS and get_maintainer.pl.  There seems to be a genral
push to make all this stuff automatable.

It's slightly more than that if you're dealing with more than one area,
and I also find this sort of stuff is a good flag for scrubbing the
patch in greater detail - when patches stand out from a 1000ft visual
overview there's a fair chance that there's other issues so if people
regularly submit good patches that have only cosmetic issues I find it's
worth guiding them away from that.

In this case if I don't apply it it's likely to end up going in via your
tree and then I'll still have to deal with the merge conflicts which are
more annoying.
