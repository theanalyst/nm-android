I don't know what you asked Joe to change, but asking someone to use
the documented canonical patch format:

<quote>
The canonical patch subject line is:

    Subject: [PATCH 001/123] subsystem: summary phrase
</quote>

should be fine.  And there is no need for printf-ish templates
for this in MAINTAINERS either.
