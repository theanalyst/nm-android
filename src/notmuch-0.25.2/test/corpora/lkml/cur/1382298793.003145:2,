I trimmed cc's and added Andrew Morton and Florian Mickler.
First thread link for them: http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/15/262

I use get_maintainer to find email addresses with
"git send-email --cc-cmd=" but sure it could be extended
to find some other new information in the MAINTAINERS file.

Anyway, I think that get_maintainers isn't the proper tool
to rewrite commit subject lines, though it could certainly
do the lookup of a key in the MAINTAINERS file.

Maybe add a new MAINTAINERS section line something like:
	"C:	CommitSubjectGrammarStyle"
where CommitSubjectGrammarStyle is something more
information rich than "style 1", "style 2".

Perhaps you'll propose a grammar to convert path to header
and go through and add these "C:" style entries to the
sections you maintain.

Also, what would you expect the output to be when a single
patch modified files from 2 subsystems that use different
styles?

cheers, Joe
