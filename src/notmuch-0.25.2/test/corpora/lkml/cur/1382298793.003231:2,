So, my general policy on this is that I tend to push back on patches
which don't just work with the toolset (subject lines are just one part
of it) to a variable extent depending on who's submitting and what
they're submitting.  One of the factors is that the more patches are
coming from someone the easier I expect their patches to be to work
with.

The reason this came up is that this is one of the issues with Joe's
patches (which are rather frequent) but he is only willing to do things
that he can automate.
