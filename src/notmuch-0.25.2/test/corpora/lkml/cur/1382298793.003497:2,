Why should we codify our conventions in MAINTAINERS to accommodate the
specific problem of virtually a _single_ patch author?

Conventions are living and are being adjusted all the time, as code
organization changes, people join and go, projects start and cease.

Said author please looks the conventions up in the git history.  If he
finds that this decelerates his patch generation rate, he can surely
code a script that looks into git for him and suggests plausible
prefixes for his patch titles to him.  Or he can collect a kind of
database (a config file) locally for his own use in which he records
conventional prefixes on the go.
