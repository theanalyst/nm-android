That's exactly what I asked him to do.  He said he's not willing to use
anything for "subsystem" which can't be automatically generated.

The formats I mentioned because some subsystems have their own things
within this format like "subsystem: driver:" or whatever.  While it's
probably not an issue for the sort of patch Joe generates if we do have
a tool for this I'd expect it'll go the same way that checkpatch does
and get used by people doing more specific work.  It'd be good to try to
head off the friction that may cause by at least having an idea how we
might cope with that.
