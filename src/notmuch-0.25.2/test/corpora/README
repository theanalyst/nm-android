This directory contains email corpora for testing.

default
  The default corpus is based on about 50 messages from early in the
  history of the notmuch mailing list, which allows for reliably
  testing commands that need to operate on a not-totally-trivial
  number of messages.

broken
  The broken corpus contains messages that are broken and/or RFC
  non-compliant, ensuring we deal with them in a sane way.

html
  The html corpus contains html parts
