I saw the LWN article and decided to take a look at notmuch.  I'm
currently using mutt and mairix to index and read a collection of
Maildir mail folders (around 40,000 messages total).

notmuch indexed the messages without complaint, but my attempt at
searching bombed out. Running, for example:

  notmuch search storage

Resulted in 4604 lines of errors along the lines of:

  Error opening
  /home/lars/Mail/read-messages.2008/cur/1246413773.24928_27334.hostname,U=3026:2,S:
  Too many open files

I'm curious if this is expected behavior (i.e., notmuch does not work
with Maildir) or if something else is going on.

Cheers,
