Hello,

First of all, notmuch is a wonderful idea, both the cmdline tool and
the emacs interface! Thanks a lot for writing it, I was really excited
when I read the announcement today.

Have you considered sending an announcement to the org-mode mailing list?
http://org-mode.org

Various ways of searching/referencing emails from emacs were discussed
there several times and none of them were as elegant as notmuch (not
even close). Maybe notmuch would attract some of the developers
there..

 Sorry, wrong URL, the correct one is: http://orgmode.org

 Ah, here's where I planned a nice welcome. So welcome (again), Jan! :-)

 I've been having a lot of fun with notmuch already, (though there have
 been some days of pain before it was functional enough and my
 email-reply latency went way up). But regardless---I got through that,
 and I'm able to work more efficiently with notmuch now than I could with
 sup before. So I'm happy.

 And I'm delighted when other people find this interesting as well.

 Thanks for the idea. I think I may have looked into org-mode years ago,
 (when I was investigating planner-mode and various emacs "personal wiki"
 systems for keeping random notes and what-not).

 Yeah. I'll drop them a mail. Having a real emacs wizard on board would
 be nice. (I'm afraid the elisp I've written so far for this project is
 fairly grim.)
