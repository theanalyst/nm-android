notmuch -- The python interface to notmuch
==========================================

This module makes the functionality of the notmuch library
(`https://notmuchmail.org`_) available to python. Successful import of
this modul depends on a libnotmuch.so|dll being available on the
user's system.

If you have downloaded the full source tarball, you can create the
documentation with sphinx installed, go to the docs directory and
"make html". A static version of the documentation is available at:

  https://notmuch.readthedocs.io/projects/notmuch-python/

To build the python bindings, do

  python setup.py install --prefix=path/to/your/preferred/location
