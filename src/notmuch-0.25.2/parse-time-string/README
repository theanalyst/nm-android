PARSE TIME STRING
=================

parse_time_string() is a date/time parser originally written for
notmuch by Jani Nikula <jani@nikula.org>. However, there is nothing
notmuch specific in it, and it should be kept reusable for other
projects, and ready to be packaged on its own as needed. Please do not
add dependencies on or references to anything notmuch specific. The
parser should only depend on the C library.
